## Contributing Open Source

1. Clone the repo
2. Open an issue at our Gitlab Issues. Describe the bug that you've found, or the feature. Note down the issue number (e.g. 12)
3. Create your feature branch ( `git checkout -b 12-my-new-feature` )
4. Commit your changes ( `git commit -am 'Added some feature'` ) It is preferred that you 'commit early and often' instead of bunching all changes into a single commit.
5. Push your branch to your branch ( `git push origin 12-my-new-feature` )
6. Create a merge request pointing to `dev`
7. The team will then review, discuss and hopefully merge your changes.
